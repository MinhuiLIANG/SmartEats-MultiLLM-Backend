- `Controllers`: integrating components to form functions;
- `Components` & `Upgrades`: LLM units;
- `DAO`: crud functions connecting to the database;
- `fixedSentences.py`: pre-defined sentences;
- `topicTreesm.py`: a tree structure for interaction flow control.

**ü•† What you need to configure:**
